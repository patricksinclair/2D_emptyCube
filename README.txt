This system is used to diagnose potential initial conditions for the biofilm distribution, and to see how it behaves.

Initially two simulations will be performed.  Both of these will have a layer of biofilm completely covering the lower riblet surface.

One will be run for 10 s with a constant flow velocity.  The other will initially be run for 4s to allow the biofilm to equilibrate, then the flow will be added.

To make things easier put the upperWall boundary condition at the top of the U file.  That way it will be easy to edit this boundary condition to change the velocity later
